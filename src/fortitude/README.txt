This is the revised folder destination for the ongoing development of Fortitude. The purpose of this folder is to distinctly separate our design system from the X Logs product, thereby establishing a system with a visible philosophy and component library that can be efficiently reused in future products.

Our goal is to evolve this folder into a fully independent, standalone module. It will be meticulously developed to ensure no dependencies on external elements outside of this folder. This transformation will be a gradual work in progress.

Additionally, this folder will equip us with the necessary tools to create a comprehensive documentation system. This system is anticipated to be implemented in any product that incorporates the folder, though it will be located externally.

In essence, this folder should be approached and managed as if it were a library. This perspective is vital as we intend to eventually transform our component library into an `npm` package.
